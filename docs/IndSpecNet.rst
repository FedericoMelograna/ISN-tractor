What are Personalized Networks?
======================================

Personalized networks refer to the construction of a network that is unique to a specific individual, taking into account their genetic and molecular information. The goal of personalized networks is to identify personalized disease mechanisms and drug targets for individuals.

What is ISN-Tractor?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ISN-tractor is a Python package designed for the extraction and integration of Individual Specific Networks (ISNs) from multiple samples. By identifying differential feature-expression and edges between samples, ISNs can provide valuable insights into personalized expression networks. ISN-tractor is a user-friendly tool that offers a simple interface for analyzing multiple datasets and generating ISNs. It can be applied in various organisms, including humans, animals, and plants. Thus, ISN-tractor is a powerful and versatile tool for identifying personalized gene expression networks in different contexts.

What are Individual Specific Networks?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Individual specific networks (ISNs) are an extension of personalized networks that focus on identifying differential interactions between molecules in different individuals. ISNs are computed by integrating individual-specific genetic and transcriptomic data to identify features that are differentially connected across individuals, even if they have similar expression levels. In other words, ISNs aim to capture inter-individual variation in feature-feature interactions that may be missed by traditional network analysis approaches. This makes ISNs a powerful tool for identifying personalized disease mechanisms and drug targets, and for understanding the genetic basis of inter-individual variation in disease susceptibility and drug response.

What is this repository for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code here contains a pytorch-based ``python3`` library that should allow anyone to compute ISNs through our method, as long as the input data matches the recommended format. 
An example of its application can be found here: (ref), and it has been published here (AHAHAHAHAHAH REF).
